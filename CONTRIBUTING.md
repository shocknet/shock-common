- Please follow the revealing module pattern.

- Please don't implement circular dependencies, however these are allowed in types.

- Please respect git hooks.

- Enums are singular-named. E.g. `Action` instead of `Actions`.

- Use dependency injection for platform-specific stuff (fetch, storage, etc).
